    question: Schedule
    answer: |-
      Subject to change at the will of the group. Except the meals. The meals are at fixed times. All unscheduled time is open time – gather in groups, bring your laptop, grab someone from the Core Team and pick our brains, play some football/soccer, tennis or go swimming in the pool — whatever you want to get out of this event, make it happen.

    question: 'Group Communication'
    answer: |-
      We set up a **#flat-campers** Discord room so everyone can try to find each other at the airport, meet up if you're getting into Charlotte early, ask questions, and share photos.

      If you're not in Discord already, please [join here](https://statamic.com/discord) and DM anyone on the Core Team to gain access.
