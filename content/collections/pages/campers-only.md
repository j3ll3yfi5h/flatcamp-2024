    question: 'Transportation Details'
    answer: |-
      The following pickup schedule is in place, but we're working to see if we can add another pickup between 2:30pm and 8pm. We don't want anyone to miss dinner (at 6:30 pm) who doesn't have to. Being able to add this extra group will depend on getting everyone's info into the [flight tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nRWL0wB0pi5C1Zu-aHTxKnbG-mABy_10sVroaDltG4k/edit?usp=sharing) so we can see if there are two cost effective groups.

      **Monday May 22 @ 2pm — Hilton Garden Inn**
      Pickup location: in front of the lobby/check-in entrance.
      Vehicle: 35 Passenger Mini Bus

      **Monday May 22 @ 2:30pm — CLT Airport**

    question: 'The Cabins'
    answer: |-
      We have 6 cabins for our event spread across the top of a private mountain. There _are_ a few additional cabins also on the mountain that we do not have access to, so please use the map below to make sure you're in the right place. Each cabin should have its name on it.

      #### Gathering Areas

      The following 3 cabins allow the full group to gather, while the other 3 only allow the assigned guests of that cabin on the property.

      Our meals will be served in **Beary Cozy Cabin**, right in the middle of the property.

      If and when we gather as a whole group, we can do so in the game room in the basement of **Elks Hidden Passage**.

      We can all also use **Blue Ridge Mountain View** and its property.

    question: 'Group Communication'
    answer: |-
      We set up a **#flat-campers** Discord room so everyone can try to find each other at the airport, meet up if you're getting into Charlotte early, ask questions, and share photos.

      If you're not in Discord already, please [join here](https://statamic.com/discord) and DM anyone on the Core Team to gain access.
