    question: 'Where is the venue?'
    answer: 'We''ve booked a privately run "Chateauform" villa right outside of Rome, Italy. This organization specifically caters to corporate retreats and small, non-traditional conference-type events, and has all the amenities needed to accommodate us for the duration. We chose this location to maximize accessibility from all of Europe, and to provide an exciting location for longer-distance travelers to explore from. Who ever complained about going to Italy?'

    question: 'What airport do I fly into?'
    answer: |-
      The closest airport is Rome-Ciampino Airport. However, the Rome Tiburtina Train Station is even closer (within 20 miles) and you may find better travel arrangements flying into another city and taking the train. You never know.

    question: 'Can I get a refund if I can’t go?'
    answer: 'If we can resell your ticket to someone on a waiting list, we''ll be happy to refund your ticket. Unfortunately, the nature and price of this event requires us to very nearly sell out in order to not lose quite a bit of money. We hope you understand!'

    question: 'What will there be to do besides talk to other people?'
    answer: |-
      Oh, there's plenty to do! We didn't want to overwhelm the group with options, but we'll have lawn games, a swimming pool, wine and drinks at our own private bar, archery, soccer/football, and all manner of outdoor activities.

      There shouldn't be a shortage of things to do and people to hang out with.

    question: 'What stuff should I bring?'
    answer: |-
      Besides the obvious like clean socks, a toothbrush, and your laptop – feel free to bring a bathing suit if you want to use the pool, camera gear if you're into photography, your favorite board game, or whatever else you want.

      If you're coming from outside Europe, don't forget to bring a power adapter for European outlets.
